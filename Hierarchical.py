# Here's how it's calculated for a single data point:

# a(i): The average distance between the data point and all other points in the same cluster. This represents cohesion.

# b(i): The smallest average distance between the data point and all points in any other cluster, of which the data point is not a member. This represents separation.

# s(i): The silhouette score for the data point is then given by (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i)).



# Calculate Cluster Dispersion: Measure the average distance of each point in the cluster to the centroid or using the variance within the cluster.

# Calculate Cluster Separation: his is usually done by computing a distance or dissimilarity metric between the centroids of the two clusters.

# Compute the Davies-Bouldin Index: Finally, compute the Davies-Bouldin Index using the formula:DB = (1 / n) * Î£(max(R_ij + R_ji))

# R_ij is the average distance between cluster i and cluster j.

# The maximum value of (R_ij + R_ji) is chosen for each cluster i.
